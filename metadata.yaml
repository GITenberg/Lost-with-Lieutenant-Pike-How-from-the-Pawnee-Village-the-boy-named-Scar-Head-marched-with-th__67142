title: 'Lost with Lieutenant Pike: How from the Pawnee Village the boy named Scar
  Head marched with the young American Chief clear into the Snowy Mountains; how in
  the dead of winter they searched for the Lost River and thought that they had found
  it; and how the Spanish Soldiery came upon them and took them down to Santa FÃ© of
  New Mexico, where another surprise awaited them'
